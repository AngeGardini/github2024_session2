# Galaxy Database Project

This repository contains a synthetic dataset of galaxies designed for hands-on training in collaborative tools like GitHub. Participants will practice forking, branching, committing, and submitting pull requests to improve and expand the dataset while adhering to best practices in collaborative research.

## Contents

`galaxy_database.csv`: A table of 30 galaxy entries with information on their redshifts, galaxy types, activities, absolute magnitudes, and references.

## How to Contribute

- Fork the repository.
- Create a new branch for your changes.
- Commit your edits and push them to your fork.
- Submit a pull request to the main repository for review.
- Do not forget to be clear and specific in your comments.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes:
```
Galaxy ID: Unique identifiers for the galaxies.
Redshift: A measure of the galaxy's distance and motion.
Galaxy Type: Classification of the galaxy (e.g., spiral, elliptical).
Activity: Notes on the galaxy's active processes (AGN, star formation, none).
Absolute Magnitude: A measure of the galaxy's luminosity.
Reference: Simulated citations for sources of the data.
Notes: Additional remarks about the galaxy.
```

## Installation

The repository does not contain software to be installed. To access the database you can explore the file `galaxy_database.csv` in Github or clone the repository to your local computer
